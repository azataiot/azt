## About **azt**

~azt is an intelligent hybrid progressive programming language that makes your development more intelligent, more faster and much more easy. It aims to become a programming language which gives it high-level, object oriented, high performanced programming. ~azt programming language is easy to learn as Python, fast enough as C++ and  generic as Java.

## Installing azt

~azt is an intelligent hybrid progressive programming language that take advantages of many other programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python and Javascript. Therefore you should have installed all the requirements first:

- a **C compiler**(for C and C++ base of azt).
  - **Linux**: The GNU C Compiler (gcc) is usually present, or easily available through the package system. On Ubuntu or Debian, for instance, the command `sudo apt-get install build-essential` will fetch everything you need.
  - **Mac OS**: The best practice is to install Xcode command line tools. type `xcode-select --install` and you follow the instructions. Or simply, you can install Xcode while it automatically installs the Xcode command line tools for you.
  - **Windows**: The azt programming language dose not even support hello world on windows operating systems! However, there sure is a alternative way to do it: You can still run azt programming language on your Windows Subsystem for Linux and google may help you to install on on your PC, after that, just follow the instructions to install azt on a linux system.
- **Python**
  - **Linux**: Simply run "sudo apt install python3" and I'm sure you will get Python3 very soon, just Try, Why not?
  - **Mac OS**: The best way to install python3 on mac os is defenetly through [`brew`](https://brew.sh/), install brew if you don't have(how did you able to breath without brew?!)  and then try: `brew install python3`.
  - **Windows**: Dear me! Just install Windows Subsystem for Linux and then follow Linux instructions for the rest, ok?
- **Node.js**
  - Both for **Linux and Mac OS**: [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install the **LTS** versions of node.js specified for your operating system.

You'will finally able to install `azt` on your system without a trouble. Please be noticed that, `azt` supports only the **Python 3** version, and that's the version you should install on your OS, if necessary run azt within a 'virtualenv'.

The simplest way of installing azt is by using `pip`:

```bash
sudo pip install azt
```

**NOTE**: You should use `sudo` command to run the code as `azt` needs administrator privilage.

Alternatively, you can also try the shell command to install azt, [download](https://azt.azat.ai/release/?latest) the latest version of azt and unzip the file, enter the azt installer folder and then simply run install.sh by:

```shell
sudo ./install.sh
```

**NOTE**: You should use `sudo` command to run the code as `azt` needs administrator privilage.

## Hello World in azt

A simple **Hello World!** program written with `azt` would be like this:

```azt
# hello_world.azt
print("Hello World!")
```

You may confused here: Is it a Python code ? Yes, and NO. However many programming languages use the same way for Hello World. But, one important message you should know here is that, azt programming language is itself a hybrid programming language that based on many other programming languages, that's the nature of azt programming language to have a similar structure of code as x programming language but extremply faster than the x programming language.

You can test it simply with timing tools, have a try!
